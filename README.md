# nba-group-final-crazy-fast
Group project for our NBA team for SI 649; with simplified, easy to use/join code base.

## Quickstart

- Clone this project to your local by `git clone https://github.com/si649-NBA/nba-group-final-crazy-fast.git`
- `cd` to project root directory
- Turn on the dev server by `. ./runserver.sh`. (We use python3's http server, you can take a look at `runserver.sh`!)
- Open your browser at `http://localhost:8001/`. There's not much there at this point...
- Look at the folders in the project root, there are `part-01-big-trend-timeseries`, `part-02-performance-viz` and `part-03-nba-player-model`, each of them correspond to the sections of our app, and has their own `HTML/CSS/JavaScript` files. 
- **Only edit the files in the folder for your designated feature.** For example, if you work on the NBA profile model, which is part 3, then only edit files that are in folder `part-03-nba-player-model`.
- There are some starter code to help you get started! But also notice that there're some parts you should not change and are highlighted for you.
- Happy coding! As long as you only modify files in your designated feature's directory, you can push your code to this repo directly w/o creating pull request. **But make sure your code is error-free before pushing to this repo**, otherwise everyone will see your error messages...ðŸ™€
