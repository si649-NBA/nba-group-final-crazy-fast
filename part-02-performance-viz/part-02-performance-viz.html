        <h2>How NBA players' height trend <br> relates to their performance?</h2>
		<div class="part2_text">
			<p>Base on the analysis of the trend players’ size overtime, are you curious about how they relates to their performance? How statistics like scoring, assist, block, rebound relates to players’ height and weight in different positions? Here we provide charts for comparison: average height vs weighted height.</p>
            <!-- <p>
                <strong class="height-color--text" >Height</strong>: the average height of each year (the overall trend).<br>
                <strong class="pts-color--text" >Points</strong>: Offensive metric. The resulting points the player scored.<br>
                <strong class="ast-color--text" >Assistant</strong>: Offensive metric. The player passes the ball to teammates and teammate scored.<br>
                <strong class="odrm-color--text" >Rebound</strong>: Neutral metric. <br>

  <div class="part2_text">
    <p>First looking at the <strong class="odrm-color--text">rebounds</strong>, height weighted by rebounds has always been above the league average, which proves taller players can get more rebounds.</p>
    <p>Contrary to rebounds, the <strong class="pts-color--text" >points</strong> distribution has been following height evolution closely thorugh the history, which means height does not have a siginicant influence on points.</p>
    <p><strong class="ast-color--text" >Assist</strong> evolution tells another interesting story, the results showed here indicates short men has a better assist rate. However, in the recent decade, this difference has been reduced, big men increased their assists to fit into the modern beyond-the-perimeter game.</p>
    <p>As for the <strong class="blk-color--text" >blocks</strong>, the weighted height is far higher then the average one, which indicats big men have been taking most blocks in the league.</p>
