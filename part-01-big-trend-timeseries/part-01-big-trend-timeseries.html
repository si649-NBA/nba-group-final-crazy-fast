			<h5>Height</h5>
			<p>In order to learn how NBA players’ average size changes in the past seventy years, we visualize both players’ height and weight in line chart to demonstrate the trend. Both height and weight can be divided into two stages as follow:</p>
			<p>Stage 1: Coaches realized the advantage of height for a typical basketball player, which led players’ average height grew rapidly from 1950 to 1980.</p>
			<p>Stage 2: Since 1980, the average height stagnated.</p>
			<h5>Weight</h5>
			<p>Stage 1: Players’ weight keep growing since 1950, and floated up and down from 1965 to 1975 </p>
			<p>Stage 2: Players’ average weight reached the peak at 2011, then started to decline, we assume it is because of the prevalent of “small ball tactics” during that time, which requires players to become agile to fit all-round plays.</p>
			<h5>Combined Height & Weight</h5>
			<p>From 1980 to 2017, height stagnated while weight kept increasing, players are becoming stronger to compete in the league. As we separate the data and divide players into five positions, in order to conform to the development of “small ball tactics”, small men are gaining more weight to become stronger to increase their physicality inside. Meanwhile, big men are becoming lighter in compensation for increasing agility, as well as the versatility of being able to play both inside and outside.</p>
